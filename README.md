## 1.1 Mathematical Operations and Order of Operations

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Mathematical Operations** are basic actions you can perform with numbers. The main ones are:
- **Addition (+)**: Combining numbers (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5)
- **Subtraction (−)**: Taking away from a number (e.g., 5 − 2 = 3)
- **Multiplication (× or ·)**: Repeated addition (e.g., 3 × 4 = 12)
- **Division (÷ or /)**: Splitting into equal parts (e.g., 12 ÷ 3 = 4)

**Order of Operations** is the rule that tells you the sequence to perform operations in a math expression.  
**PEMDAS** is a helpful acronym:
- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents (powers and roots)
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

**Visual Representation:**

```
        ___________
       |           |
       | 3 + 2 × 4 |
       |___________|
First: Multiply (2 × 4 = 8)
Then: Add (3 + 8 = 11)
```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Consistency**: Everyone gets the same answer if they follow the same rules.
- **Real-World Use**: Calculating prices, measurements, or splitting things fairly.
- **Foundation for Algebra**: Understanding order of operations is crucial for solving equations in higher math.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Parentheses First**: Solve anything in ( ) or [ ].
2. **Exponents**: Calculate powers and roots.
3. **Multiplication/Division**: Work from left to right.
4. **Addition/Subtraction**: Work from left to right.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Doing addition before multiplication.
- Ignoring parentheses.

**Memory Trick:**  
**PEMDAS** or the phrase: "**Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally**".

#### Example 1

**Problem:**  
6 + 3 × 2

**Solution:**  
- Multiplication first: 3 × 2 = 6  
- Then addition: 6 + 6 = **12**

#### Example 2

**Problem:**  
(5 + 2) × 4

**Solution:**  
- Parentheses first: 5 + 2 = 7  
- Then multiplication: 7 × 4 = **28**

#### Example 3

**Problem:**  
8 − 2 × (3 + 1)

**Solution:**  
- Parentheses: 3 + 1 = 4  
- Multiplication: 2 × 4 = 8  
- Subtraction: 8 − 8 = **0**

## 1.2 Estimation and Rounding

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Estimation** is making a smart guess about the value of a number or answer, often to make calculations easier.

**Rounding** means changing a number to a nearby value that is easier to work with, usually to the nearest ten, hundred, or decimal place.

**Key Terms:**
- **Estimate**: An approximate calculation.
- **Round up**: Increase the digit.
- **Round down**: Keep the digit the same.

**Visual Representation:**

```
Number Line Example:
      47
-----|----|----|----|----|----
    40   45   50   55   60

47 is closer to 50, so we round it to 50.
```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Quick Calculations**: Useful when you need an answer fast.
- **Checking Work**: Helps see if an exact answer makes sense.
- **Real Life**: Estimating costs while shopping, time to travel, or ingredients in cooking.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Rounding Steps:
1. **Find the place value** you need to round to (e.g., tens, hundreds).
2. **Look at the digit to the right** of that place.
   - If it's 5 or more, **round up**.
   - If it's 4 or less, **round down**.
3. **Change all digits to the right** to zeros (for whole numbers) or drop them (for decimals).

#### Estimation Strategies:
- **Front-end estimation**: Use the first digits and adjust.
- **Compatible numbers**: Use numbers that are easy to work with mentally.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Rounding the wrong digit.
- Forgetting to change the digits after the rounded place.

#### Example 1

**Problem:**  
Round 473 to the nearest ten.

**Solution:**  
- Look at the tens place: 7 (70)
- Look at the ones place: 3 (less than 5, so round down)
- Answer: **470**

#### Example 2

**Problem:**  
Estimate 29 × 41.

**Solution:**  
- Round 29 to 30, 41 to 40
- 30 × 40 = **1200** (Estimate)

#### Example 3

**Problem:**  
Round 5.678 to the nearest hundredth.

**Solution:**  
- Hundredth place: 7
- Next digit: 8 (5 or more, round up)
- Answer: **5.68**

- **Variables (x, y, n)**: Letters that stand for numbers
- **Expressions**: Math phrases (e.g., 2x + 3)
- **Equations**: Math sentences with an equals sign (e.g., 2x + 3 = 7)

**Visual Representation:**

| Symbol | Meaning         | Example      |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| +      | Addition       | 3 + 4 = 7    |
| −      | Subtraction    | 9 − 2 = 7    |
| × or · | Multiplication | 6 × 3 = 18   |
| ÷ or / | Division       | 8 ÷ 2 = 4    |
| =      | Equals         | x = 5        |

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- Forgetting what a variable stands for.

#### Example 1

**Problem:**  
What does 2n + 5 = 11 mean?

**Solution:**  
- 2n means 2 times some number n.
- 2n + 5 means add 5 to that result.
- The equation says this is equal to 11.

#### Example 2

**Problem:**  
Write "five more than a number y" as a mathematical expression.

**Solution:**  
- "A number y": y
- "Five more than": +5
- Expression: **y + 5**

#### Example 3

**Problem:**  
What does the symbol "≠" mean in 7 ≠ 9?

**Solution:**  
- "≠" means "not equal to"
- 7 is not equal to 9, so the statement is true.

---

## 1.4 Logical Reasoning and Deduction

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Logical Reasoning** is using clear, step-by-step thinking to solve problems or make decisions.

**Deduction** means drawing a specific conclusion from general information or rules.

**Key Terms:**
- **Premise**: A statement you start with.
- **Conclusion**: What you figure out from the premises.
- **If...then statements**: Used to connect ideas (e.g., If it rains, then the ground gets wet.)

**Visual Representation:**

```
If A → B (If A happens, then B happens)
A is true.
Therefore, B is true.
```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Problem Solving**: Helps break down complex problems.
- **Everyday Life**: Making decisions, solving mysteries, or playing strategy games.

4. **Check if your conclusion makes sense.**

**Common Mistakes:**
- Jumping to conclusions without enough information.
- Mixing up cause and effect.

#### Example 1

**Problem:**  
If all dogs bark, and Max is a dog, does Max bark?

**Solution:**  
- Premise 1: All dogs bark.
- Premise 2: Max is a dog.
- Conclusion: Max barks. (Yes)

#### Example 2

**Problem:**  
If it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella.  
It is raining.  
What can you conclude?

**Solution:**  
- Premise: If it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella.
- Fact: It is raining.
- Conclusion: I will bring an umbrella.

#### Example 3

**Problem:**  
If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2.  
Is 15 even?

**Solution:**  
- 15 ÷ 2 = 7.5, not a whole number.
- 15 is not divisible by 2, so 15 is not even.

A factor of a number is a whole number that divides exactly into another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 3 is a factor of 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

**Multiples:**  
A multiple of a number is the result of multiplying that number by any whole number. For example, 24 is a multiple of 6 because 6 × 4 = 24.

**Divisibility:**  
A number is divisible by another if it can be divided evenly, with no remainder. For example, 20 is divisible by 5 because 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

**Key Terms:**
- **Divisor:** Another word for factor.
- **Dividend:** The number being divided.
- **Divisibility Rules:** Quick checks to see if a number is divisible by another.

**Visual Representation:**  
Factors of 12:  
12 = 1 × 12  
12 = 2 × 6  
12 = 3 × 4  
So, factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

- "Multiples Move Out" (they are bigger than or equal to the number).

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*Find all the factors of 18.*

**Solution:**  
Check numbers from 1 to 18:  
- 1 × 18 = 18

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.  
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17...

**Composite Number:**  
A composite number has more than two factors.  
Examples: 4 (1, 2, 4), 6 (1, 2, 3, 6)

**Prime Factorization:**  
Writing a number as a product of prime numbers.  
Example: 12 = 2 × 2 × 3

**Key Terms:**
- **Prime:** Only factors are 1 and itself.
- **Composite:** More than two factors.

**Visual Representation:**  
Prime factor tree for 24:  
```
     24
    /  \
   2   12
      /  \
     2    6
         / \
        2   3
```
So, 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Mathematics:** Prime numbers are the "building blocks" of all numbers.
- **Real Life:** Used in cryptography (internet security), coding, and puzzles.
- **Other Concepts:** Helps with LCM, GCD, and simplifying fractions.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

2. Test divisibility by all primes less than or equal to its square root.
3. If no divisors, it's prime.

#### Prime Factorization (Factor Tree)
1. Divide the number by the smallest prime (start with 2).
2. Continue dividing each result by primes until all factors are prime.
3. Write the number as a product of these primes.

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Thinking 1 is prime (it is **not**).
- Stopping factorization too early.

#### Memory Techniques
- "2 is the only even prime."
- "If a number is not prime, it's composite."

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*Is 29 a prime number?*

**Solution:**  
Check divisibility by 2, 3, and 5 (since √29 ≈ 5.4):  
- 29 ÷ 2 = 14.5 (not whole)  
- 29 ÷ 3 ≈ 9.67 (not whole)  
- 29 ÷ 5 = 5.8 (not whole)  
No divisors, so **29 is prime**.

---

**Example 2:**

- 12 = 2 × 2 × 3  
- 18 = 2 × 3 × 3

GCD: Common primes: one 2 and one 3 → 2 × 3 = **6**  
LCM: All primes (use highest powers): 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = **36**

---

**Example 2:**  
*What is the LCM of 8 and 12?*

**Solution:**  
Prime factors:  
- 8 = 2 × 2 × 2  
- 12 = 2 × 2 × 3

---

**Example 3:**  
*Find the GCD of 24 and 36 using the Euclidean Algorithm.*

**Solution:**  
36 ÷ 24 = 1, remainder 12  
24 ÷ 12 = 2, remainder 0  
So, **GCD is 12**.

---

## 4. Remainders and Modular Arithmetic

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Remainder:**  
When you divide one number by another, the remainder is what is left over after dividing as many times as possible.  
Example: 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder **2**.

**Modular Arithmetic ("mod"):**  
A system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value (the modulus).  
Example: 17 mod 5 = **2** (the remainder when 17 is divided by 5).

**Key Terms:**
- **Dividend:** Number being divided.
- **Divisor:** Number you divide by.
- **Quotient:** Result of division.
- **Remainder:** What's left.
- **Modulus:** The number you are "wrapping around."

**Visual Representation:**  
17 ÷ 5 = 3, with 2 left over.  
So, 17 = 5 × 3 + 2

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Mathematics:** Important for solving problems with cycles, patterns, and digital clocks.
- **Real Life:** Used in calendars, computer science, and games (e.g., "every 3rd person wins a prize").
- **Other Concepts:** Connects to division, factors, and multiples.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Finding the Remainder
1. Divide the number by the divisor.
2. Multiply the quotient by the divisor.
3. Subtract from the original number.

#### Using Modular Arithmetic
1. Write: a mod n = r (where r is the remainder when a is divided by n).
2. Use properties:  
   - (a + b) mod n = [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n  
   - (a × b) mod n = [(a mod n) × (b mod n)] mod n

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Mixing up quotient and remainder.
- Forgetting the remainder must be less than the divisor.

#### Memory Techniques
- "mod" means "remainder after division."

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*What is the remainder when 23 is divided by 4?*

**Solution:**  
23 ÷ 4 = 5 remainder 3  
So, the remainder is **3**.  
Or, 23 mod 4 = **3**

---

**Example 2:**  
*What is 15 mod 6?*

**Solution:**  
15 ÷ 6 = 2 remainder 3  
So, 15 mod 6 = **3**

---

**Example 3:**  
*What is (8 + 13) mod 5?*

**Solution:**  
8 + 13 = 21  
21 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 1  
So, (8 + 13) mod 5 = **1**

Or,  
8 mod 5 = 3  
13 mod 5 = 3  
(3 + 3) mod 5 = 6 mod 5 = **1**

`2y = 14`

Step 2: Divide both sides by 2:  
`2y ÷ 2 = 14 ÷ 2`  
`y = 7`

Check: `2 × 7 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10` ✔️

## 4. Applications of Equations in Word Problems

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
A **word problem** is a math question written in everyday language. **Applying equations** means translating the problem into an equation and then solving it.

**Key Terminology:**
- **Unknown:** The quantity you need to find (use a variable for this).
- **Translate:** Change words into math symbols and equations.
- **Equation:** A mathematical sentence with an equals sign.

**Visual Representation:**

```
Words  →  Equation  →  Solution
```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why is this important?**  
  Word problems connect math to real life. They help you use math to solve everyday problems.
- **Real-world applications:**  
  - Figuring out prices, ages, distances, or times
  - Planning events or making purchases
  - Solving puzzles and games
- **Connection to other math:**

- Misinterpreting the wording
- Forgetting units (like dollars, meters, etc.)

**Memory Technique:**  
"**Let x be the unknown!**"

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
Sarah has 3 more apples than Tom. Together they have 17 apples. How many apples does Tom have?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let `x` = number of apples Tom has.  
Sarah has `x + 3` apples.

Step 2: Write equation:  
`x + (x + 3) = 17`

Step 3: Combine like terms:  
`2x + 3 = 17`

Step 4: Subtract 3:  
`2x = 14`

Step 5: Divide by 2:  
`x = 7`

**Tom has 7 apples.**  
Sarah has `7 + 3 = 10` apples.

---

**Example 2:**  
A movie ticket costs $8. How many tickets can you buy with $50?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let `n` = number of tickets.

Step 2: Write equation:  
`8n = 50`

Step 3: Divide both sides by 8:  
`n = 50 ÷ 8 = 6.25`

Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, you can buy **6 tickets**.

---

**Example 3:**  
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 cm. If the length is 2 cm more than the width, what are the rectangle's dimensions?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let `w` = width (cm).  
Length = `w + 2`

Step 2: Perimeter formula:  
`Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 24`

Step 3: Plug in values:  
`2((w + 2) + w) = 24`  
`2(2w + 2) = 24`  
`4w + 4 = 24`

Step 4: Subtract 4:  
`4w = 20`

Step 5: Divide by 4:  
`w = 5`

Length = `5 + 2 = 7`

**The rectangle is 5 cm by 7 cm.**

## Chapter 6: Inequalities and Absolute Value

# Chapter 6: Inequalities and Absolute Value

---

## 1. Understanding Inequalities

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
An **inequality** is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between two values when they are not equal. Instead of an equals sign (=), inequalities use special symbols:

- **Greater than:** `>` (Example: \( x > 3 \) means \( x \) is greater than 3)
- **Less than:** `<` (Example: \( y < 5 \) means \( y \) is less than 5)
- **Greater than or equal to:** `\geq` (Example: \( a \geq 2 \) means \( a \) is at least 2)
- **Less than or equal to:** `\leq` (Example: \( b \leq 7 \) means \( b \) is at most 7)

**Key Terms:**
- **Inequality:** A comparison showing that two values are not equal.
- **Solution:** A value or set of values that make the inequality true.

**Visual Representation:**  
Think of the number line:

- For \( x > 2 \):

  ```
  <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6
              (open circle at 2, shade right)
  ```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Inequalities allow us to describe a range of possible values, not just one answer. They're used whenever we need to set limits or boundaries.

- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - If a roller coaster requires you to be at least 48 inches tall, that's \( h \geq 48 \).
  - If you can spend no more than $10 on snacks, that's \( s \leq 10 \).

- **Connections:**  
  Inequalities are closely related to equations, number lines, and algebraic expressions.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### How to Read and Graph Inequalities

1. **Identify the inequality symbol** and understand what it means.
2. **Draw a number line** if needed.
3. **Use an open circle** for `<` or `>`, and a **closed circle** for `\leq` or `\geq`.
4. **Shade** the side of the number line that represents the solution.

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Mixing up the inequality symbols.
- Forgetting to use open/closed circles.
- Not shading the correct direction.

#### Memory Techniques

- The symbol `<` looks like an "L" for "less than."
- The wide side of the symbol always faces the larger number.

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*Graph \( x < 4 \) on a number line.*

**Solution:**  
- Open circle at 4 (not included).
- Shade everything to the left of 4.

**Example 2:**  
*What does \( y \geq 7 \) mean?*

**Solution:**  
- \( y \) can be 7 or any number greater than 7.

**Example 3:**  
*Write an inequality for: "A number \( n \) is at least 10."*

**Solution:**  
- "At least" means greater than or equal to: \( n \geq 10 \).

---

## 2. Solving Inequalities

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
Solving an inequality means finding all values that make the inequality true.

**Key Concepts:**
- You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to solve inequalities, just like equations.
- **Important:** If you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, you must **reverse the inequality sign**!

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Solving inequalities helps us find all possible solutions to real-life problems, not just a single answer.

- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Budgeting: "I need to save at least $50" (\( s \geq 50 \))
  - Sports: "You must score more than 80 points to win" (\( p > 80 \))

- **Connections:**  
  Building on solving equations, inequalities add the idea of a range of answers.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Steps to Solve Simple Inequalities

1. **Isolate the variable** on one side using addition or subtraction.
2. **Use multiplication or division** to solve for the variable if necessary.
3. **If you multiply or divide by a negative number, flip the inequality sign!**
4. **Graph** your answer on a number line if asked.

#### Multiple Solution Approaches

- You can check your answer by plugging values back into the original inequality.

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying/dividing by a negative.
- Not checking your solution.

#### Memory Techniques

- "Negative flip": Negative numbers flip the sign.

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*Solve \( x + 3 < 8 \).*

**Solution:**  
1. Subtract 3 from both sides:  
   \( x + 3 - 3 < 8 - 3 \)  
   \( x < 5 \)

**Example 2:**  
*Solve \( -2y \geq 6 \).*

**Solution:**  
1. Divide both sides by -2 (remember to flip the sign):  
   \( y \leq -3 \)

**Example 3:**  
*Solve \( 4z - 7 > 5 \).*

**Solution:**  
1. Add 7 to both sides:  
   \( 4z > 12 \)  
2. Divide by 4:  
   \( z > 3 \)

---

## 3. Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
The **absolute value** of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, always positive or zero.

- Written as \( |x| \).
- Examples: \( |5| = 5 \), \( |-7| = 7 \), \( |0| = 0 \)

**Absolute Value Equation:**  
An equation involving \( |x| \), like \( |x| = 4 \).

**Absolute Value Inequality:**  
An inequality involving \( |x| \), like \( |x| < 3 \).

**Key Terms:**
- **Absolute value:** Distance from zero, always non-negative.

**Visual Representation:**

- \( |x| = 2 \) means \( x \) is 2 units away from 0, so \( x = 2 \) or \( x = -2 \).

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Absolute value helps us measure distances and differences, regardless of direction.

- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Temperature changes: "How far from freezing?"
  - Game scores: "How many points away from zero?"

- **Connections:**  
  Links to number lines, distance, and solving equations/inequalities.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Solving Absolute Value Equations

1. Set up two cases:
   - \( x = a \)
   - \( x = -a \)
2. Solve each case.

#### Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

- For \( |x| < a \): \( -a < x < a \)
- For \( |x| > a \): \( x < -a \) or \( x > a \)

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to create both cases (positive and negative).
- Using negative numbers for absolute value answers (absolute value is never negative).

#### Memory Techniques

- "Absolute value = distance": Always think about distance from zero.

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*Solve \( |x| = 5 \).*

**Solution:**  
- \( x = 5 \) or \( x = -5 \)

**Example 2:**  
*Solve \( |y| < 4 \).*

**Solution:**  
- \( -4 < y < 4 \)

**Example 3:**  
*Solve \( |z - 2| \geq 7 \).*

**Solution:**  
- Set up two cases:  
  \( z - 2 \geq 7 \) or \( z - 2 \leq -7 \)
- Solve each:  
  \( z \geq 9 \) or \( z \leq -5 \)

---

## 4. Applications in Problem Solving

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
Using inequalities and absolute value to solve real-life problems where more than one answer is possible.

**Key Concepts:**
- Translating words to inequalities.
- Using inequalities to describe limits, minimums, or maximums.

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Most real-world problems have more than one possible answer, and inequalities help us describe all solutions.

- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Age restrictions: "You must be at least 12 years old."
  - Speed limits: "Do not exceed 60 mph."
  - Temperature ranges: "Keep between 2°C and 8°C."

- **Connections:**  
  Combines reading, algebra, and logic skills.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Steps for Application Problems

1. **Read the problem carefully.**
2. **Identify key information** and assign variables.
3. **Translate words into inequalities or absolute value statements.**
4. **Solve the inequality or equation.**
5. **Answer the question and interpret the result.**

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Misreading "at least" (≥) or "no more than" (≤).
- Forgetting to check if your answer makes sense in context.

#### Memory Techniques

- "At least" = ≥  
- "At most"/"no more than" = ≤  
- "More than" = >  
- "Less than" = <

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1:**  
*You need at least 15 points to win a prize. Write and solve an inequality for the number of points \( p \) you need.*

**Solution:**  
- "At least" means \( p \geq 15 \).
- Any \( p \) value 15 or greater wins the prize.

**Example 2:**  
*The temperature in a lab must stay within 5°C of 20°C. Write and solve an absolute value inequality for the temperature \( t \).*

**Solution:**  
- "Within 5°C of 20°C" means \( |t - 20| \leq 5 \).
- So, \( -5 \leq t - 20 \leq 5 \)
- Add 20 to all sides: \( 15 \leq t \leq 25 \)

**Example 3:**  
*A ride requires you to be taller than 120 cm but no more than 200 cm. Write an inequality for height \( h \).*

**Solution:**  
- "Taller than 120 cm" means \( h > 120 \)
- "No more than 200 cm" means \( h \leq 200 \)
- Combined: \( 120 < h \leq 200 \)

## Chapter 7: Sequences, Patterns, and Functions

# Chapter 7: Sequences, Patterns, and Functions

## Overview

This chapter explores how numbers and shapes can be organized in special ways called **sequences** and **patterns**, and how we can use **functions** to describe and predict these arrangements. These ideas are key to solving many AMC 8 problems!

---

## 1. Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

### WHAT

#### Definition

- **Sequence:** An ordered list of numbers following a specific rule.
- **Arithmetic Sequence:** A sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same. This difference is called the **common difference**.
- **Geometric Sequence:** A sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by the same number. This number is called the **common ratio**.

#### Key Terminology

- **Term:** Each number in the sequence.
- **First Term (\(a_1\))**: The starting number of the sequence.
- **Common Difference (\(d\))**: The amount added in an arithmetic sequence.
- **Common Ratio (\(r\))**: The amount multiplied in a geometric sequence.
- **General Term (\(a_n\))**: The \(n\)th term in the sequence.

#### Visual Representation

**Arithmetic Sequence Example:**  
`2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...` (Add 3 each time)

**Geometric Sequence Example:**  
`3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...` (Multiply by 2 each time)

---

### WHY

- **Mathematics:** Sequences help us organize information, spot patterns, and make predictions.
- **Real-World:** Arithmetic sequences model things like saving money each week, while geometric sequences show how things grow or shrink quickly (like bacteria, investments, or folding paper).
- **Connections:** Understanding sequences prepares you for algebra, graphing, and problem-solving in higher math.

---

### HOW

#### Arithmetic Sequence: Finding the \(n\)th Term

1. **Identify the first term (\(a_1\)) and common difference (\(d\)).**
2. **Use the formula:**  
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
3. **Plug in values to find any term.**

#### Geometric Sequence: Finding the \(n\)th Term

1. **Identify the first term (\(a_1\)) and common ratio (\(r\)).**
2. **Use the formula:**  
   \[
   a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}
   \]
3. **Plug in values to find any term.**

#### Common Mistakes

- Mixing up arithmetic and geometric sequences.
- Forgetting to subtract 1 from \(n\) in the formula.
- Using addition instead of multiplication (or vice versa).

#### Memory Tip

- **Arithmetic = Add** (both start with "A")
- **Geometric = Grow** (both start with "G")

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1: Arithmetic Sequence**

*Find the 10th term of the sequence: 4, 7, 10, 13, ...*

**Step 1:** First term (\(a_1\)) = 4  
**Step 2:** Common difference (\(d\)) = 3  
**Step 3:** Use formula:  
\[
a_{10} = 4 + (10-1)\times3 = 4 + 27 = 31
\]

**Answer:** The 10th term is **31**.

---

**Example 2: Geometric Sequence**

*What is the 6th term of the sequence: 2, 8, 32, ...?*

**Step 1:** First term (\(a_1\)) = 2  
**Step 2:** Common ratio (\(r\)) = 4 (since \(8/2 = 4\))  
**Step 3:** Use formula:  
\[
a_6 = 2 \times 4^{5} = 2 \times 1024 = 2048
\]

**Answer:** The 6th term is **2048**.

---

**Example 3: Identifying Sequence Type**

*Is the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ... arithmetic or geometric?*

- Check differences: \(6-3=3\), \(12-6=6\), \(24-12=12\) (not the same).
- Check ratios: \(6/3=2\), \(12/6=2\), \(24/12=2\) (all the same).

**Answer:** This is a **geometric sequence** with common ratio 2.

---

## 2. Patterns and Recursive Relationships

### WHAT

#### Definition

- **Pattern:** A repeated or regular way in which something happens or is done.
- **Recursive Relationship:** A rule that tells you how to find the next term in a sequence using one or more previous terms.

#### Key Terminology

- **Recursive Rule:** The formula that uses previous term(s) to get the next one.
- **Initial Term(s):** The starting value(s) needed to begin the sequence.

#### Visual Representation

**Recursive Example:**  
If \(a_1=2\), and \(a_{n}=a_{n-1}+5\), the sequence is:  
\(2, 7, 12, 17, ...\)

---

### WHY

- **Mathematics:** Recognizing patterns and using recursive rules helps solve complex problems step by step.
- **Real-World:** Patterns appear in music, art, nature (like the petals of a flower), and schedules.
- **Connections:** Recursive thinking is important for computer programming and advanced math.

---

### HOW

#### Writing a Recursive Formula

1. **Identify how each term relates to the previous one.**
2. **Write the starting value(s) (initial term(s)).**
3. **Express the rule using previous term(s).**

#### Finding Terms Using Recursion

1. **Start with the initial term(s).**
2. **Apply the recursive rule repeatedly to find next terms.**

#### Common Mistakes

- Not specifying the initial term(s).
- Using the wrong previous term in the rule.

#### Memory Tip

- "Recursive" means "repeating" — use what you already have to get what's next!

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1: Recursive Pattern**

*Given \(b_1 = 1\), and \(b_{n} = b_{n-1} + 4\), find the first five terms.*

- \(b_1 = 1\)
- \(b_2 = 1 + 4 = 5\)
- \(b_3 = 5 + 4 = 9\)
- \(b_4 = 9 + 4 = 13\)
- \(b_5 = 13 + 4 = 17\)

**Answer:** 1, 5, 9, 13, 17

---

**Example 2: Doubling Pattern**

*Start with 3, and each term is double the previous. Write a recursive formula and list the first four terms.*

- **Recursive Formula:** \(c_1 = 3\), \(c_{n} = 2 \times c_{n-1}\)
- \(c_1 = 3\)
- \(c_2 = 2 \times 3 = 6\)
- \(c_3 = 2 \times 6 = 12\)
- \(c_4 = 2 \times 12 = 24\)

**Answer:** 3, 6, 12, 24

---

**Example 3: Pattern in Shapes**

*You make a pattern with squares: 1 square in the first row, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, etc. How many squares in the 8th row?*

- Each row adds 1 more square than the last.
- Recursive rule: \(d_1 = 1\), \(d_{n} = d_{n-1} + 1\)
- \(d_8 = 1 + (8-1) = 8\)

**Answer:** 8 squares in the 8th row.

---

## 3. Introduction to Functions

### WHAT

#### Definition

- **Function:** A rule that assigns exactly one output to each input.
- **Input (Domain):** The value you start with.
- **Output (Range):** The result after applying the function.

#### Key Terminology

- **Function Notation:** \(f(x)\) means "the function \(f\) at input \(x\)".
- **Rule:** The operation(s) that turn input into output.

#### Visual Representation

| Input (\(x\)) | Rule (\(+2\)) | Output (\(f(x)\)) |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
|      1        |   \(1+2=3\)   |         3         |
|      2        |   \(2+2=4\)   |         4         |
|      3        |   \(3+2=5\)   |         5         |

---

### WHY

- **Mathematics:** Functions help us model and understand relationships between quantities.
- **Real-World:** Functions are everywhere! For example, a vending machine gives you a snack (output) for each button you press (input).
- **Connections:** Functions are the foundation for algebra, graphing, and more advanced math.

---

### HOW

#### Evaluating a Function

1. **Identify the rule (what the function does to the input).**
2. **Plug the input value into the rule.**
3. **Calculate the output.**

#### Writing a Function Rule

1. **Look for a pattern between input and output.**
2. **Express the rule as an equation, like \(f(x) = 2x + 1\).**

#### Common Mistakes

- Confusing input and output.
- Not applying the rule correctly.

#### Memory Tip

- Think of a function as a "machine": put something in, get something out!

---

#### Worked Examples

**Example 1: Evaluating a Function**

*If \(f(x) = 3x - 2\), what is \(f(5)\)?*

- Plug in \(x=5\):  
  \(f(5) = 3 \times 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13\)

**Answer:** \(f(5) = 13\)

---

**Example 2: Finding a Function Rule**

*The input-output table is:*

| Input (\(x\)) | Output (\(y\)) |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|       2       |       7        |
|       4       |      11        |
|       6       |      15        |

- Find the pattern:  
  \(2 \to 7\), \(4 \to 11\), \(6 \to 15\)
- Check differences:  
  \(7-2=5\), \(11-4=7\), \(15-6=9\) — but notice, for each increase of 2 in input, output increases by 4.
- Try \(y = 2x + 3\):  
  For \(x=2\), \(2(2)+3=7\); for \(x=4\), \(2(4)+3=11\); for \(x=6\), \(2(6)+3=15\)

**Answer:** The function rule is \(y = 2x + 3\).

---

**Example 3: Using a Function in a Word Problem**

*A taxi charges $3 to start, plus $2 per mile. Write a function for the total cost (\(C\)) for \(m\) miles, and find the cost for 5 miles.*

- Function: \(C(m) = 3 + 2m\)
- For \(m=5\): \(C(5) = 3 + 2 \times 5 = 3 + 10 = 13\)

**Answer:** The total cost is $13.

---

## 4. Applications in AMC 8 Problems

### WHAT

# Chapter 8: Coordinate Geometry

Coordinate Geometry is a powerful tool that helps us describe and solve geometric problems using numbers and equations. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the coordinate plane to plot points, find distances and midpoints, graph lines and curves, and solve geometric problems.

---

## 8.1 The Cartesian Plane

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

- **Definition:** The Cartesian Plane (also called the coordinate plane) is a flat surface formed by two number lines that cross at a right angle. The horizontal line is called the **x-axis**, and the vertical line is called the **y-axis**. Their intersection is called the **origin** (0, 0).
- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Origin:** The point (0, 0) where the axes meet.
  - **Quadrants:** The plane is divided into four regions called quadrants.
  - **Coordinates:** Every point is represented by an ordered pair (x, y).
- **Visual Representation:**

  ```
      y
      ↑
  II | I
   --+--→ x
  III| IV
  ```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:** The Cartesian Plane lets us describe the location of points precisely. It’s the foundation for graphing equations and solving geometric problems using algebra.
- **Real-World Applications:** Maps (using latitude and longitude), video game graphics, and even GPS navigation use coordinate systems.
- **Connections:** Links algebra (equations) with geometry (shapes and distances).

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Plotting Points

1. **Start at the Origin (0, 0).**
2. **Move right (positive) or left (negative) along the x-axis.**
3. **Move up (positive) or down (negative) along the y-axis.**
4. **Mark the point.**

#### Reading Coordinates

- The first number is the x-coordinate (horizontal).
- The second number is the y-coordinate (vertical).

#### Common Mistakes

- Reversing x and y values.
- Forgetting negative signs.

#### Memory Tip

- Remember: **x** comes before **y** in the alphabet, so (x, y).

#### **Worked Examples**

**Example 1:** Plot the point (3, -2).

- Start at the origin.
- Move 3 units to the right (x = 3).
- Move 2 units down (y = -2).
- Mark the point.

**Example 2:** What quadrant is the point (-4, 5) in?

- x is negative, y is positive → **Quadrant II**.

**Example 3:** Name the coordinates of the point shown below:

  ```
      y
      ↑
        •
      --+--→ x
         (4, 3)
  ```

- The point is at (4, 3).

  \]

- **Midpoint Formula:** Used to find the point exactly halfway between two points:

  \[
  \text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
  \]

- **Key Terms:**
  - **Distance:** How far apart two points are.
  - **Midpoint:** The point directly in the middle of two points.

- **Midpoint:** "Average the x’s, average the y’s."

#### **Worked Examples**

**Example 1:** Find the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6).

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

**Example 2:** Find the midpoint between (2, 5) and (8, 3).

\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{2 + 8}{2}, \frac{5 + 3}{2} \right) = (5, 4)
\]

**Example 3:** The endpoints of a line segment are (-3, 7) and (5, -1). Find the distance and the midpoint.

- Distance:

  \[
  \sqrt{(5 + 3)^2 + (-1 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + (-8)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 64} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}
  \]

- Midpoint:

  \[
  \left( \frac{-3 + 5}{2}, \frac{7 + (-1)}{2} \right) = (1, 3)
  \]

## Chapter 11: Counting and Combinatorics

# Chapter 11: Counting and Combinatorics

Welcome to Chapter 11! In this chapter, we'll explore the fascinating world of counting and combinatorics — the mathematics of counting, arranging, and selecting objects. These concepts are not only important for math competitions like the AMC 8, but also for solving real-life problems.

---

## 1. The Counting Principle

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
The Counting Principle (also called the Fundamental Principle of Counting) is a way to find the total number of possible outcomes when there are several choices to make, one after another.

- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Outcome:** The result of a choice or event.
  - **Event:** A choice or action (like picking a shirt or rolling a die).
  - **Product Rule:** Multiply the number of choices for each event.

**Visual Representation:**  
Suppose you have 2 shirts (red, blue) and 3 pants (jeans, shorts, khakis):

```
Shirt:   Red    Blue
Pants:   J S K  J S K
         | | |  | | |
         ↓ ↓ ↓  ↓ ↓ ↓
Outfits: 6 total (2 shirts × 3 pants)
```

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  The Counting Principle helps us quickly find the total number of ways to do things without listing every possibility.
- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Choosing outfits (shirts, pants, shoes)
  - Creating meal combinations (main, side, drink)
  - Setting up passwords (letters, numbers)
- **Connection to Other Concepts:**  
  It's the foundation for permutations, combinations, and probability.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Identify each event/choice.**
2. **Count the number of options for each event.**
3. **Multiply the numbers together.**

**Common Mistake:**  
Adding instead of multiplying when choices are independent.

#### Worked Example 1

**Q:** You have 3 hats (red, blue, green) and 2 scarves (yellow, black). How many different hat-scarf combinations can you wear?

**A:**  
- Choices for hats: 3  
- Choices for scarves: 2  
- Total combinations = 3 × 2 = **6**

#### Worked Example 2

**Q:** A sandwich shop lets you choose 1 bread (white, wheat), 1 filling (turkey, ham, cheese), and 1 topping (lettuce, tomato). How many different sandwiches can you make?

**A:**  
- Bread: 2 options  
- Filling: 3 options  
- Topping: 2 options  
- Total sandwiches = 2 × 3 × 2 = **12**

#### Worked Example 3

**Q:** A password is made of 2 letters (A, B, C) followed by 1 digit (1, 2). How many different passwords are possible?

**A:**  
- First letter: 3 options  
- Second letter: 3 options  
- Digit: 2 options  
- Total passwords = 3 × 3 × 2 = **18**

---

## 2. Permutations and Arrangements

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
A **permutation** is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. Order matters in permutations.

- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Permutation:** An ordered arrangement.
  - **n! (n factorial):** The product of all numbers from n down to 1. For example, 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.
  - **Arrangement:** The way objects are placed in sequence.

**Visual Representation:**  
Arranging 3 books (A, B, C) on a shelf:

- Possible orders: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA (Total: 6 = 3!)

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Permutations help us count how many ways we can arrange things when order matters.
- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Arranging students in a line
  - Scheduling events
  - Forming PIN codes
- **Connection to Other Concepts:**  
  Used in probability, cryptography, and more.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Decide if order matters.** (If yes, use permutations.)
2. **Use the formula:**  
   - For arranging all n objects: n!
   - For arranging r out of n objects: n! / (n - r)!

**Common Mistake:**  
Confusing permutations (order matters) with combinations (order doesn't matter).

**Memory Trick:**  
"Permutation" starts with "P" like "Position" — order/position matters.

#### Worked Example 1

**Q:** How many ways can 4 students stand in a line?

**A:**  
- Number of students: 4
- Arrangements = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = **24**

#### Worked Example 2

**Q:** How many ways can you arrange 3 out of 5 books on a shelf?

**A:**  
- Total books: 5
- Arranging 3: 5! / (5-3)! = 5 × 4 × 3 = **60**

#### Worked Example 3

**Q:** How many different 2-digit numbers can you make using the digits 1, 2, and 3, if no digit repeats?

**A:**  
- First digit: 3 choices  
- Second digit: 2 choices (since no repeats)  
- Total = 3 × 2 = **6** numbers (12, 13, 21, 23, 31, 32)

---

## 3. Combinations and Selections

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
A **combination** is a selection of objects where order does **not** matter.

- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Combination:** A group or selection where order doesn't matter.
  - **nCr or C(n, r):** Number of ways to choose r items from n.  
    Formula: nCr = n! / [r! × (n - r)!]
  - **Selection:** Choosing items without arranging them.

**Visual Representation:**  
Choosing 2 fruits from apple, banana, cherry:  
- AB, AC, BC (Same as BA, CA, CB — order doesn't matter)

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Combinations help us count how many ways we can select groups when order doesn't matter.
- **Real-World Applications:**  
  - Choosing a team from a class
  - Picking toppings for a pizza
  - Selecting books to read
- **Connection to Other Concepts:**  
  Used in probability, statistics, and more.

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Decide if order matters.** (If not, use combinations.)
2. **Use the combination formula:**  
   nCr = n! / [r! × (n - r)!]
3. **Plug in the values and calculate.**

**Common Mistake:**  
Counting the same group multiple times because of different orders.

**Memory Trick:**  
"Combination" = "Committee" — order doesn't matter in a committee.

#### Worked Example 1

**Q:** How many ways can you choose 2 friends from a group of 4?

**A:**  
- n = 4, r = 2  
- 4C2 = 4! / (2! × 2!) = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / [(2 × 1) × (2 × 1)] = 24 / 4 = **6**

#### Worked Example 2

**Q:** A pizza shop offers 5 toppings. How many ways can you choose 3 toppings for your pizza?

**A:**  
- n = 5, r = 3  
- 5C3 = 5! / (3! × 2!) = 120 / (6 × 2) = 120 / 12 = **10**

#### Worked Example 3

**Q:** From 6 different books, how many ways can you select 4 to borrow?

**A:**  
- n = 6, r = 4  
- 6C4 = 6! / (4! × 2!) = 720 / (24 × 2) = 720 / 48 = **15**

---

## 4. Applications in Word Problems

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Definition:**  
Applications in word problems involve using counting, permutations, or combinations to solve real-life or competition-style scenarios.

- **Key Terminology:**
  - **Scenario:** The situation described in the problem.
  - **Constraint:** A rule or limit (e.g., "no repeats," "at least one," etc.)
  - **Approach:** Deciding which counting method to use.

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

5. **Apply the correct formula or counting principle.**
6. **Check your answer for reasonableness.**

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using the wrong method (permutation vs. combination).
- Missing or misinterpreting constraints.

**Memory Technique:**  
Underline or highlight important information and constraints in the problem.

#### Worked Example 1

**Q:** A club has 7 members. How many ways can they select a president, vice-president, and secretary, if each person can hold only one position?

**A:**  
- Positions: 3 (order matters: president ≠ vice-president)
- First position: 7 choices  
- Second: 6 choices  
- Third: 5 choices  
- Total = 7 × 6 × 5 = **210**

#### Worked Example 2

**Q:** How many different 3-person committees can be formed from a group of 8 students?

**A:**  
- Committees: order doesn't matter
- n = 8, r = 3  
- 8C3 = 8! / (3! × 5!) = 56

#### Worked Example 3

## Chapter 12: Probability and Statistics

# Chapter 12: Probability and Statistics

Probability and statistics help us understand how likely things are to happen and how to make sense of data. These topics are essential in everyday life and often appear in AMC 8 problems. Let’s explore each subtopic in detail!

---

## 1. Basic Probability Concepts

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Probability** is a way to measure how likely an event is to happen.  
- **Event:** Something that can happen (like rolling a 5 on a die).
- **Outcome:** The result of a single trial (like rolling a 2).
- **Sample Space:** All possible outcomes (like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for a die).
- **Probability Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{Probability of an event} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
  \]
- **Certain Event:** Probability = 1 (will always happen)
- **Impossible Event:** Probability = 0 (can never happen)

**Visual Representation:**  
If you have a spinner with 4 equal sections (red, blue, green, yellow), the chance of landing on any color is 1 out of 4.

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why important?** Probability helps us make predictions and informed decisions.
- **Real-world examples:** Weather forecasts, board games, sports, predicting chances of winning a prize.
- **Connection:** Probability connects to fractions, ratios, and logical thinking.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**Steps to Find Probability:**
1. **List all possible outcomes** (sample space).
2. **Count the number of favorable outcomes** (what you want).
3. **Use the probability formula.**
4. **Simplify the fraction** if possible.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to count all possible outcomes.
- Not simplifying the fraction.
- Mixing up favorable outcomes with total outcomes.

**Memory Tip:**  
Think "Favorable over Total" (F/T).

---

#### Worked Example 1

**Question:** What is the probability of rolling a 3 on a standard six-sided die?

**Solution:**
1. **Sample Space:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (6 outcomes)
2. **Favorable Outcome:** Rolling a 3 (just 1 way)
3. **Probability:**  
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

---

#### Worked Example 2

**Question:** A bag contains 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles. What is the probability of picking a blue marble at random?

**Solution:**
1. **Sample Space:** 3 red + 2 blue = 5 marbles
2. **Favorable Outcomes:** 2 blue marbles
3. **Probability:**  
   \[
   \frac{2}{5}
   \]

---

#### Worked Example 3

**Question:** What is the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads?

**Solution:**
1. **Sample Space:** {Heads, Tails} (2 outcomes)
2. **Favorable Outcome:** Heads (1 way)
3. **Probability:**  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}
   \]

---

## 2. Compound Events and Expected Value

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

- **Compound Event:** An event made up of two or more simple events (like rolling two dice).
- **Independent Events:** Events where the outcome of one does not affect the other (like flipping two coins).
- **Dependent Events:** Events where the outcome of one affects the other (like drawing two cards without replacement).
- **Expected Value:** The average outcome you expect if you repeat an experiment many times.

**Visual Representation:**  
A tree diagram helps show all possible outcomes for compound events.

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why important?** Compound events let us analyze more complex situations.
- **Real-world examples:** Card games, board games, predicting multiple events (like weather on two days).
- **Connection:** Uses multiplication and addition, connects to probability and averages.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

**For Compound Events:**
1. **Independent Events:**  
   Multiply the probabilities.  
   \[
   P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
   \]
2. **Dependent Events:**  
   Adjust the probability after the first event.
3. **OR Events (either A or B):**  
   Add the probabilities if events cannot happen at the same time.

**For Expected Value:**
1. **List all possible outcomes and their probabilities.**
2. **Multiply each outcome by its probability.**
3. **Add up the results.**
   \[
   \text{Expected Value} = \sum (\text{Outcome} \times \text{Probability})
   \]

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to adjust for dependent events.
- Confusing "and" (multiply) with "or" (add).
- Not using all possible outcomes for expected value.

**Memory Tip:**  
"And" means multiply, "or" means add (for mutually exclusive events).

---

#### Worked Example 1 (Compound Event)

**Question:** What is the probability of flipping two coins and both landing heads?

**Solution:**
1. **Independent events:**  
   Probability of heads on first coin = 1/2  
   Probability of heads on second coin = 1/2
2. **Multiply:**  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

---

#### Worked Example 2 (Dependent Event)

**Question:** A bag has 2 red and 3 blue marbles. What is the probability of picking a red marble, then a blue marble, **without replacement**?

**Solution:**
1. **First pick (red):** 2 red out of 5 = 2/5
2. **Second pick (blue):** Now 3 blue out of 4 marbles = 3/4
3. **Multiply:**  
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}
   \]

---

#### Worked Example 3 (Expected Value)

**Question:** You roll a fair six-sided die. What is the expected value of the number you roll?

**Solution:**
1. List outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (each has probability 1/6)
2. Multiply each outcome by its probability:
   \[
   (1 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (2 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (3 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (4 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (5 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (6 \times \frac{1}{6})
   \]
3. Add:
   \[
   \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
   \]
   So, the expected value is **3.5**.

---

## 3. Organizing and Interpreting Data

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

- **Data:** Information collected, often as numbers.
- **Frequency:** How many times something happens.
- **Mean (Average):**  
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all data}}{\text{Number of data points}}
  \]
- **Median:** The middle value when data is in order.
- **Mode:** The value that appears most often.
- **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest values.

**Visual Representation:**  
Bar graphs, line plots, and tables help organize data.

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why important?** Data helps us make sense of real-world information.
- **Real-world examples:** Test scores, sports statistics, survey results.
- **Connection:** Organizing data helps solve probability problems and make predictions.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

1. **Organize data** in a table or graph.
2. **Find mean:** Add up all values, divide by the number of values.
3. **Find median:** Order values, find the middle one.
4. **Find mode:** Look for the value that appears most.
5. **Find range:** Subtract smallest from largest.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to order data for median.
- Confusing mean and median.
- Not counting data points correctly.

**Memory Tip:**  
Mean = "Mean Machine" (add and divide), Median = "Middle," Mode = "Most."

---

#### Worked Example 1

**Question:** Find the mean, median, mode, and range of the data: 4, 7, 7, 2, 9.

**Solution:**
1. **Order data:** 2, 4, 7, 7, 9

3. **Continue Until the Beginning:** Keep reversing until you reach the starting point.

#### Guess & Check
1. **Make a Guess:** Choose a possible answer.
2. **Check:** Plug your guess into the problem.
3. **Adjust:** If it doesn't work, make a new, better guess.
4. **Repeat:** Continue until you find the correct answer.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not keeping track of guesses (write them down!)
- Forgetting to adjust guesses logically (make smarter guesses each time)

**Memory Tip:**  
Think of "rewinding" a movie for working backwards, and "hotter/colder" game for guess & check.

---

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1: Working Backwards

**Problem:**  
Sarah had some candies. She gave 3 to her friend, then ate 2 herself. Now she has 5 left. How many candies did she start with?

**Solution:**  
- Final result: 5 candies left.
- Step before: Before she ate 2, she had 5 + 2 = 7.
- Step before: Before she gave away 3, she had 7 + 3 = 10.
- **Answer:** Sarah started with **10 candies**.

---

#### Example 2: Guess & Check

**Problem:**  
Find a two-digit number whose digits add up to 9 and is divisible by 5.

**Solution:**  
- Possible numbers with digits adding to 9: 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90.
- Numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5: 45, 90.
- Check: 4 + 5 = 9 (Yes), 9 + 0 = 9 (Yes).
- **Answers:** The numbers are **45 and 90**.

---

#### Example 3: Guess & Check (with Adjustment)

**Problem:**  
I am thinking of a number. If you double it and subtract 4, you get 10. What is the number?

**Solution:**

**Solution:**  
- Draw two bars:  
  - Ben: |-----|  
  - Amy: |-----| + |---| (3 more)
- Together: Ben + Amy = 13  
  Let Ben = x. Then Amy = x + 3.  
  x + (x + 3) = 13 → 2x + 3 = 13 → 2x = 10 → x = 5
- **Answers:** Ben has **5**, Amy has **8** apples.

---

#### Example 2: Table

**Problem:**  
A bus leaves every 15 minutes starting at 8:00 AM. When do the 4th and 6th buses leave?

---

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1: Process of Elimination

**Problem:**  
Which number is divisible by both 2 and 3?  
A) 12 B) 14 C) 15 D) 17

**Solution:**  
- Divisible by 2: 12, 14.
- Divisible by 3: 12, 15.
- Both: Only 12.
- **Answer:** **A) 12**

---

#### Example 2: Deductive Reasoning

**Problem:**  
Three friends—Alex, Ben, and Cara—each have a different pet: a cat, a dog, and a bird.  
- Alex does not have the dog.  
- Ben does not have the bird.  
Who has the cat?

**Solution:**  
- List possibilities.

|       | Cat | Dog | Bird |
|-------|-----|-----|------|
| Alex  | ?   | No  | ?    |
| Ben   | ?   | ?   | No   |
| Cara  | ?   | ?   | ?    |

- Since Alex cannot have the dog, and Ben cannot have the bird, if Ben had the cat, then Cara would have to have the dog or bird. Try Ben = cat.

- Assign:  
  Ben = cat  
  Alex ≠ dog, so Alex = bird  
  Cara = dog

- Ben ≠ bird (ok), Alex ≠ dog (ok), all different.  
- **Answer:** **Ben has the cat.**

---

#### Example 3: Multiple Choice Elimination

**Problem:**  
Which of the following is NOT a prime number?  
A) 2 B) 11 C) 15 D) 17

**Solution:**

- 15: 3 × 5 (not prime).  
- 17: Prime.  
- **Answer:** **C) 15**

---

---

## 13.4 Pattern Recognition and Invariants

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

#### Pattern Recognition
- **Definition:** Noticing and using repeating sequences, shapes, or numbers to predict what comes next or solve problems.
- **Key Terms:** Sequence, regularity, repetition, progression.

#### Invariants
- **Definition:** A property or quantity that stays the same (remains unchanged) even as the situation changes.
- **Key Terms:** Constant, unchanged, fixed.

- **Visual:**  
  ![Pattern Example](https://i.imgur.com/7Vg8t1K.png)  
  *(Number patterns, shape sequences, coloring problems)*

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Why Important:**  
  Patterns help you make predictions and spot shortcuts. Invariants help you prove that something is impossible or must happen a certain way.
- **Real-World Examples:**  
  - Pattern: Days of the week, seasons, traffic lights.
  - Invariant: The total number of socks before and after sorting.
- **Connections:**  
  Used in algebra (sequences), geometry (tiling), and computer science (loops).

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Pattern Recognition
1. **List Out Terms:** Write out several terms or objects in order.
2. **Look for Changes:** See how each term is related to the one before.
3. **Describe the Pattern:** Is it adding, multiplying, alternating?
4. **Predict Next Terms:** Use your rule to find missing or future terms.

#### Invariants
1. **Identify What Stays the Same:** Is there a number or property that doesn’t change?
2. **Test After Each Step:** Check if your invariant holds after each action.
3. **Use to Solve/Prove:** Use the invariant to answer the question.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Missing a pattern by not writing enough terms.
- Assuming a pattern too soon.
- Not checking if the invariant really stays the same.

**Memory Tip:**  
“Patterns repeat, invariants stay!”

---

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1: Pattern Recognition (Number Sequence)

**Problem:**  
What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ___?

**Solution:**  
- Each number is double the previous.
- 16 × 2 = **32**
- **Answer:** The next number is **32**.

---

#### Example 2: Pattern Recognition (Shape Sequence)

**Problem:**  
A pattern of triangles and squares repeats: Triangle, Square, Triangle, Square, ...  
What is the 7th shape?

**Solution:**  
- Odd positions: Triangle. Even: Square.
- 7 is odd → **Triangle**

---

#### Example 3: Invariant (Parity)

**Problem:**  
You have 10 red and 10 blue socks in a drawer. Every time you take out two socks, you put back one red sock if they are the same color, and one blue if they are different. What color is the last sock left?

**Solution:**  
- Let’s track the number of blue socks: Each time you pick two socks:
    - If same: blue count stays the same or decreases by 2.
    - If different: blue count decreases by 1.
- The parity (odd/even) of the blue socks changes only when you pick two different colors.
- Start: 10 blue (even). Each "different" pair reduces blue by 1, making it odd.
- But after all possible pairs, the last sock left is **blue**, because the parity of blue never changes from even to odd.

---

#### Example 4: Invariant (Sum)

**Problem:**  
In a game, you can add 3 or subtract 5 from a number. If you start at 0, can you ever reach 1?

**Solution:**  
- Try a few steps: 0 + 3 = 3; 3 + 3 = 6; 6 - 5 = 1.
- But let's look for an invariant: Every move changes the number by 3 or -5.
- Any number you reach is a combination of 3a - 5b.
- 3a - 5b = 1 → Try values:
    - Try a = 2, b = 1: 3×2 - 5×1 = 6 - 5 = 1.
- **Answer:** Yes, you can reach 1.

**Key Terms:**
- **Puzzle:** A problem designed to test ingenuity or knowledge.
- **Logic:** Reasoning conducted according to strict principles of validity.
- **Riddle:** A question or statement intentionally phrased to require clever thinking.

**Visual Example:**  
![Sudoku Example](https://i.imgur.com/5F3yqk4.png)  
*A simple Sudoku puzzle, a classic math puzzle.*

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Develops Problem-Solving Skills:** Puzzles teach you to look at problems from different angles and try new strategies.
- **Encourages Creativity:** There’s often more than one way to solve a puzzle.
- **Real-World Connections:** Many real-life situations, like planning a trip or organizing items, use the same logical reasoning as puzzles.
- **Math Competition Skills:** Many AMC 8 problems are inspired by classic puzzles.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### General Strategy for Solving Puzzles

1. **Understand the Rules:** Read the problem carefully. What are you allowed to do?
2. **Look for Patterns:** Are there repeating numbers, shapes, or steps?
3. **Simplify the Problem:** Break it into smaller pieces or try simpler cases.
4. **Trial and Error:** Try different possibilities and keep track of what works.
5. **Check Your Work:** Make sure your answer fits all the conditions.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Missing a rule or condition.
- Giving up too soon—sometimes the answer is just one step away!
- Forgetting to check all possibilities.

---

#### Example 1: The Missing Dollar Puzzle

**Puzzle:**  
Three friends buy a pizza for \$30. They each pay \$10. The pizza actually costs \$25, so the cashier gives \$5 back. The delivery person keeps \$2 as a tip and gives \$1 back to each friend. Now, each friend paid \$9 (\$27 total), plus the \$2 tip makes \$29. Where is the missing dollar?

**Solution:**

- Each friend gets \$1 back, so they paid \$9 each (\$27 total).
- Out of this \$27, \$25 went to the pizza, \$2 went to the tip.
- The trick is in the wording: \$27 already includes the tip; there is no missing dollar.
- The extra dollar comes from incorrectly adding the tip to the \$27 instead of subtracting it.

**Key Point:**  
Always be careful with how you add and subtract amounts in word puzzles!

---

#### Example 2: The River Crossing Puzzle

**Puzzle:**  
A farmer needs to take a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. He can only take one at a time. If left alone, the wolf will eat the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbage. How can he get all three across safely?

**Solution:**

1. Take the goat across first.
2. Go back and take the cabbage.
3. Bring the goat back.
4. Take the wolf across.
5. Go back alone and bring the goat across.

**Key Point:**  
Use trial and error and track who is left on each side to avoid disasters!

---

#### Example 3: The 9 Dots Puzzle

**Puzzle:**  
Connect all 9 dots using four straight lines without lifting your pencil from the paper.

```
● ● ●
● ● ●
● ● ●
```

**Solution:**

- The trick is to “think outside the box” and let your lines extend beyond the grid.
- Draw lines that go beyond the edge to connect more dots in fewer lines.

## 14.2 Game Strategies and Nim Games

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Game strategies** are plans or methods used to win games, especially those with simple rules but deep thinking. **Nim games** are a type of mathematical game where players take turns removing objects (like sticks or stones) from piles, and the goal is to be the player who takes the last object.

**Key Terms:**
- **Strategy:** A plan for winning.
- **Nim-sum:** The result of adding pile sizes using binary (base-2) addition without carrying.
- **Winning Position:** A situation where the player can guarantee a win if they play correctly.
- **Losing Position:** A situation where no matter what you do, your opponent can win.

**Visual Example:**  
![Nim Game Example](https://i.imgur.com/5kM8aW1.png)  
*Three piles with 3, 4, and 5 stones.*

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Critical Thinking:** Teaches you to plan ahead and anticipate your opponent’s moves.
- **Computer Science:** Many algorithms use game strategies similar to Nim.
- **Everyday Life:** Strategy games like chess or checkers use similar thinking.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Nim Game Strategy

1. **Write the pile sizes in binary.**
2. **Find the Nim-sum** (binary addition without carrying).
3. **If the Nim-sum is 0:** You’re in a losing position. If not, you can win!
4. **Make a move that changes the Nim-sum to 0.**

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to use binary addition.
- Not double-checking pile sizes after a move.

---

#### Example 1: Basic Nim Game

**Problem:**  
There are three piles with 3, 4, and 5 stones. On your turn, you can remove any number of stones from one pile. How do you win?

**Solution:**

1. **Write in binary:**
   - 3 = 011
   - 4 = 100
   - 5 = 101

2. **Find the Nim-sum:**
   - 011 ⊕ 100 ⊕ 101 = 010 (which is 2 in decimal)

3. **Since the Nim-sum is not 0, you can win.**
4. **How to move:**  
   - Remove 2 from the pile of 4 (making it 2).
   - Now piles are 3, 2, 5.
   - Binary: 011, 010, 101.
   - Nim-sum: 011 ⊕ 010 ⊕ 101 = 000.
   - Now the Nim-sum is 0; your opponent is in a losing position.

---

#### Example 2: Single-Pile Game

**Problem:**  
There is a single pile of 7 stones. You can remove 1, 2, or 3 stones each turn. Who will win?

**Solution:**

- This is similar to the game "Take-Away."
- If you leave a multiple of 4 for your opponent, you win.
- 7 is not a multiple of 4, so remove 3 stones (leaving 4).
- Now, no matter what your opponent does, you can always take enough to leave 0.

---

#### Example 3: Two-Pile Game

**Problem:**  
Two piles: 6 and 6 stones. You can remove any number from one pile on your turn. What’s the strategy?

**Solution:**

- Nim-sum: 6 ⊕ 6 = 0. (Losing position)
- If you go first, your opponent can always mirror your moves.
- If your opponent removes x from one pile, you remove x from the other.
- So, **try to avoid leaving equal piles unless you’re going second!**

---

---

## 14.3 Parity, Coloring, and Invariant Arguments

### WHAT (Clear Definition)

**Parity** is about whether numbers are even or odd. **Coloring arguments** use colors to spot patterns or prove something is impossible. **Invariant arguments** rely on something that doesn’t change (an invariant) during a process.

**Key Terms:**
- **Parity:** Evenness or oddness of a number.
- **Coloring:** Assigning colors to objects to reveal patterns.
- **Invariant:** A property that stays the same even as other things change.

**Visual Example:**  
![Chessboard Coloring](https://i.imgur.com/7j3qQn4.png)  
*A chessboard colored black and white.*

---

### WHY (Importance and Applications)

- **Proof and Reasoning:** Many problems can be solved by spotting something that never changes.
- **Computer Science:** Invariants are used in programming and debugging.
- **Games and Puzzles:** Parity and coloring help solve many classic puzzles.

---

### HOW (Step-by-Step Methods)

#### Parity Arguments

1. **Check if the numbers involved are even or odd.**
2. **See if the process changes parity.**
3. **If the final step requires a different parity, it’s impossible.**

#### Coloring Arguments

1. **Color the objects (like a chessboard) in a helpful way.**
2. **See if the process changes the coloring pattern.**
3. **Use the coloring to prove or disprove something.**

#### Invariant Arguments

1. **Find a property that doesn’t change (invariant).**
2. **Show that this invariant makes a certain outcome impossible or necessary.**

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not checking all possibilities for parity.
- Coloring in a way that doesn’t actually help.
- Missing the invariant.

#### Example 1: Domino Tiling on a Chessboard

**Problem:**  
Can you cover a standard 8x8 chessboard (with 64 squares) with 32 dominoes (each domino covers 2 squares) if you remove two opposite corners?

**Solution:**

1. Color the chessboard like a checkerboard.
2. Each domino covers one black and one white square.
3. The two opposite corners are the same color (both white or both black).
4. Removing two same-color squares leaves 30 of one color and 32 of the other.
5. Impossible to cover because dominoes always cover one of each color.

---

#### Example 2: Odd and Even Jumps

**Problem:**  
If you start at 0 and can add either 2 or 3 each move, can you ever reach 1?

**Solution:**

- Starting at 0 (even), adding 2 or 3:
  - 0 + 2 = 2 (even)
  - 0 + 3 = 3 (odd)
- Next moves:
  - 2 + 2 = 4 (even)
  - 2 + 3 = 5 (odd)
  - 3 + 2 = 5 (odd)
  - 3 + 3 = 6 (even)
- But notice: Each move changes parity (even to odd or odd to even).
- You can reach 1 by 0 + 3 + 3 = 6, but never 1. So it’s **impossible**.

---

#### Example 3: Invariant in Coin Flipping

**Problem:**  
You have 5 coins, all heads up. Each move, you can flip any 2 coins. Can you get all tails up?

**Solution:**

- Let’s count the number of heads.
- Each move changes the number of heads by 0 or 2 (parity doesn’t change).
- Starting with 5 (odd), but to get all tails (0 heads, even) is impossible.

3. **Look for patterns or invariants.**

#### Magic Squares

1. **Fill the grid so every row, column, and diagonal has the same sum.**
2. **Use patterns (like the “Siamese method” for odd-sized squares).**
3. **Check your work by adding up all rows, columns, and diagonals.**

**Common Mistakes:**
- Skipping a step in a trick.
- Misplacing numbers in magic squares.

---

#### Example 1: The “Pick a Number” Trick

**Trick:**  
1. Think of a number.
2. Double it.
3. Add 10.
4. Divide by 2.
5. Subtract your original number.

**No matter what number you start with, the answer is always 5!**

**Explanation:**  
Let your number be x.

- Double it: 2x
- Add 10: 2x + 10
- Divide by 2: (2x + 10)/2 = x + 5
- Subtract original number: (x + 5) – x = 5

---

#### Example 2: Magic Square Creation

**Problem:**  
Fill a 3x3 grid with the numbers 1–9 so every row, column, and diagonal adds to 15.

**Solution:**

| 8 | 1 | 6 |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 5 | 7 |
| 4 | 9 | 2 |

**Check:**
- Rows: 8+1+6=15, 3+5+7=15, 4+9+2=15
- Columns: 8+3+4=15, 1+5+9=15, 6+7+2=15
- Diagonals: 8+5+2=15, 6+5+4=15

---

#### Example 3: The 1089 Trick

**Trick:**  
1. Pick any three-digit number where the first and last digits differ by at least 2 (e.g., 532).
2. Reverse the digits (235).
3. Subtract the smaller from the larger (532 – 235 = 297).
4. Reverse the result (792).
5. Add the two results (297 + 792 = 1089).

**No matter what number you start with, the answer is always 1089!**
